TrayWave is designed to be lightweight:

- CPU usage: near zero when idle
- Memory usage: approximately **40–80 MB PSS** during playback

> Some system monitors may display higher values due to shared Qt libraries.

## 💡 Philosophy

TrayWave is inspired by classic Linux tray radio tools, but aims to be:

- more modular
- more responsive
- focused on real‑world tray usability

No clutter. No unnecessary windows. Just music — directly from the tray.

🎶 Enjoy!
